    "# Predicting and ranking the likelihood of water presence on the lunar poles based on given features\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Problem Understanding and Data Preparation:\n",
    "- **Features:** 6 features (longitude, latitude, 4 remote sensing values).\n",
    "- **Label:** A value from 0-7 indicating the likelihood of water presence.\n",
    "- **Objective:** Predict the label and rank points better than standard integer labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Choice of Architecture:\n",
    "Combination of:\n",
    "- **Fully Connected (Dense) Neural Networks** for feature extraction and prediction.\n",
    "- **Ranking Loss Function** to ensure the model learns to rank the points effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Model Architecture:\n",
    "- **Input Layer:** 6 input neurons corresponding to your features.\n",
    "- **Hidden Layers:** Several dense layers to capture non-linear relationships.\n",
    "  - **Batch Normalization:** To ensure stability and faster convergence.\n",
    "  - **Dropout:** To prevent overfitting.\n",
    "- **Output Layer:** A single neuron representing the predicted label, activated appropriately (e.g., softmax for classification or a linear activation for regression if treated as a ranking score).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Custom Loss Function:\n",
    "To incorporate ranking into the model, a custom loss function should be designed. We will start with **Pairwise Ranking Loss** and consider **Triplet Loss** if time.\n",
    "- **Pairwise Ranking Loss:** This loss ensures that the model learns to score pairs of points correctly, meaning if point A is better than point B, the model should assign a higher score to A than to B.\n",
    "- **Triplet Loss:** Similar to pairwise, but uses triplets of points (anchor, positive, negative) to ensure that the anchor is closer to the positive than the negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Training Strategy:\n",
    "- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Experiment with different learning rates, batch sizes, and network architectures to find the optimal setup.\n",
    "- **Evaluation Metrics:** Use metrics like precision, recall, and especially ranking metrics like mean reciprocal rank (MRR) or normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) to evaluate model performance."
